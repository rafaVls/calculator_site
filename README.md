## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; all at the same time (windows calculator style)
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Typescript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project I tried a variety of implementations for the basic functionality of a calculator. What ended up working for me was to utilize classes. I come from a C# and Python background, so I felt right at home when it came to implementing classes in Javascript.

```typescript
class ButtonClickHandler {
    private equation: Array<Array<string>>;
    private _row: number;

    constructor() {
        this.equation = new Array();
        this._row = 0;
        this.equation[this._row] = new Array();
    }
...
}
```

### Continued development

I feel like I need to familiarize myself better with "prefer-color-scheme", since I didn't really spend time implementing it in this case.

### Useful resources

- [a11y Styled Form Controls](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_styled_form_controls) - This repo helped me figure out what would be an accessible implementation of the theme toggle section, and I'll keep it in handy for future projects.
- [Andrew's Multi-Position Radio Switches](https://codepen.io/renddrew/pen/bRomab?editors=1100) - This is a great codepen which helped me understand and visualize the structure of the html needed to implement a theme toggle.
